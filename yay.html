            <p>This is all just to let you know thank you for being there for me💗</p>
            <p>I still can’t believe how we met.</p>
            <p>We were just strangers who met online and started talking… and at that time, I was really lonely.</p>
            <p>Then you entered my life, started talking to me, and somehow everything started feeling sorted ✨</p>
            <p>You are the nicest and sweetest girl to me 🥺💖</p>
            <p>I don’t even know why I’m sending this today I just felt like saying it.</p>
            <p>Priya, I hope you never leave me buddy🤞💞</p>
